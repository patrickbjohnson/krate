                <h1>Thank you!</h1>
                <p>Seriously, thank you all for letting me join you this summer. It's been a fun three months and I've learned more just sitting with you all, talking, than I have in the year I've been developing as an amatuer. For that, for really showing me the joy in in building great products, I personally thank you all.</p>

                    <h2>Jamie</h2>
                    <p>I've never had a boss as organized and awesome as you. The complete opposite of micromanager you really allowed me to grow, with the team and as a developer. I owe you lunch, where I'll probably ask a lot of questions. More importantily, thank you for allowing me to join the Krate team, even if for a short while. </p>

                    <p>Batch exports. Ohhhh batch exports how I love thee! Thank you for all the extra knowlege in Photoshop, Fireworks or anything else. While I'm not a designer, I now know that I won't drown in the potentially cofusing tools that designesr live in day-by-day. I also owe you for the motivation to make some good lunches.</p>

                    <h2>Milos</h2>
                    <p>Little did you know, or maybe you did, I sometimes got nervous when working on a project. That it wouldnt' be up to Krate's standards or I was doing it just out-right wrong. Your calm vibes and easy-going outlook on development proved to me that every problem had a solution and there is never a reason to panic. And worst case scenario, copy and paste. </p>

                    <h2>Edwin</h2>
                    <p>I owe you many baked goods. At least during the first week at Krate I did. Thank you for taking time out of your day to help me learn the beginnings of Git or the MailChimp integration we did with Washington Square Park. One day I'll be the keyboard command wizard you are. Just not so sure I'll be vim worthy, though.</p>

                    <h2>Jack</h2>
                    <p>At least one-third of my time was spent at your desk talking about the latest CSS3 spec or experimenting on the finer moments in front-end development. You taught me far more than I ever imagined and I've never met a more curious developer. You made it clear that code fluency didn't finish a project, but the will to satisfy your curiosity in a new language, work-flow or technique is the fuel to make a project great. If I'm one-tenth as curious as you were I'll be happy.</p>

                    <h2>Ocho</h2>
                    <p>Since I don't speak dog I'm hoping Jamie can translate with doggy treats or hugs. Thanks, Ocho, you made those troubling IE days easier to stomach with the impromptu petting sessions.</p>
